    "description": "This word stems from the name Zephyrus, the Greek god of the west wind.\na warm and humid westerly wind blowing from the Atlantic coast. It has a fairly high speed, sometimes reaching storm force. It is accompanied by cloudy weather in southern Europe. Prevails in the Mediterranean Sea, starting in spring, and reaches its greatest intensity by the day of the summer solstice. Zephyr is the Greek name of the west wind, which has been established in the Russian tradition. In Europe it is known as ponennte, with linguistic variations ponent, poniente, ponend, ponendos, etc., the Romans called Favonius. It is sometimes thought that the origin of the ancient Greek name “zephyr” comes from Dr.-Greek ζοφερος - dark, gloomy, sunset. In the eastern part of continental Europe and the Mediterranean Sea it often brought with it rains and even storms, whereas on further eastward the character of the zephyr softened, so that it was almost always a light, pleasant breeze[3]. Hence the difference in the ideas about Zephyrus of the Greeks, who considered it one of the strongest and most impetuous winds, and the Romans, who connected with it and now caused by it the idea of a caressing, light wind"

    "adjective": "",
    "verb": "",
    "description": "Eudaimonia is a Greek word that translates to the condition of \"good spirit.\" “Eudaimonia” is a term derived from ancient Greek philosophy that is often translated as ‘happiness’ or ”well-being.” However, its meaning is much deeper and is related to the concept of a fulfilling and virtuous life. In Aristotle's philosophy, for example, eudaimonia is seen as the highest goal of human life, achieved through practicing the virtues and realizing one's potential. It is not merely a state of temporary pleasure, but a steady state of well-being and harmony that is achieved through moral and intellectual effort. Thus, “eudaimonia” can be understood as a state in which one lives in accordance with one's values, develops one's abilities, and leads a life of meaning."
